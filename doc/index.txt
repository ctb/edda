Welcome to ANGUS!
=================

ANGUS is a site built around the `2010 course on Analyzing
Next-Generation Sequencing Data
<http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2010>`__.  It
contains a number of detailed tutorials on mapping, assembly, mRNAseq,
ChIP-seq, and resequencing analysis.  Enjoy!

Major updates and news on future courses (this and others!) will be
posted to the `ngs-course-announce mailing list
<http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/ngs-course-announce>`__; join to keep
up.

We would like to especially thank the MSU `Gene Expression in Development
and Disease Focus Group <http://www.bch.msu.edu/GEDD/>`__ for funding
this course!

If this is your first visit, you should probably either look through
the :doc:`tutorials/index` or jump right into 
:doc:`workshop/index`.
