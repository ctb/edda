These are the electronic materials to accompany a webinar I gave on
metagenome assembly, sponsored by the Human Microbiome Project Data
Analysis Coordination Center.  A recording will be available soon.

The slides are `available here <http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/2013-hmpassemblywebinar>`__.

Ask questions about this on the khmer@lists.idyll.org mailing list
(you will need to sign up `here

Running tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run through the below tutorials, follow `these instructions for
starting up a cloud machine
<http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2012/start-up-an-ec2-instance.html>`__,
with two key alterations:

1. Use the AMI ami-999d49f0, the latest `StarCluster AMI <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/>`__.
2. Use an m2.xlarge sized machine -- or at least something with more than 10 GB of memory.

Then, log in to the machine (`Mac instructions <http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2012/log-in-with-ssh-mac.html>`__ and `Windows instructions <http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2012/log-in-with-ssh-win.html>`__) and move on to the first link below, "installing assemblers".
