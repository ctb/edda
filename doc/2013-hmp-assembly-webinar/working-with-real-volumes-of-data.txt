Preparing the data you just used - filtering, normalizing, partitiong
=====================================================================

On the previous pages, I was just showing you how to work with subsets
of the HMP mock Illumina metagenome.  How would you work with many
millions of reads? What kind of up-front filtering should be done?

Here are my notes from preparing the partitions used in previous pages.
They may not be quite as copy & paste as the previous pages, because
they take a long time.  Corrections welcome!

You'll need to install FASTX; see
:doc:`../2013-04-assembly-workshop/installing-software`.

First, grab the two data sets from the Short Read Archive.  Protip:
EBI/ENA lets you download SRA files directly as FASTQ!!!! ::

   wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR172/SRR172903/SRR172903.fastq.gz
   wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR172/SRR172902/SRR172902.fastq.gz

Now, trim them nicely with the FASTX quality filter::

   gunzip -c SRR172902.fastq.gz | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > SRR172902-trim.fastq
   gunzip -c SRR172903.fastq.gz | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > SRR172903-trim.fastq

Next, apply digital normalization; normalize them together, because they
come from the same underlying genomes::

   python ~/khmer/scripts/normalize-by-median.py -k 20 -C 10 -x 2e9 -N 4 --savehash trim.kh *-trim.fastq

Take the output files and trim them at highly connected graph regions::

   python ~/khmer/sandbox/filter-below-abund.py trim.kh *-trim.fastq.keep

Rename them to '.fq' files because khmer is currently stoooopid and
doesn't know how to figure out file types without looking at the filename::

   for i in *.below; do mv $i $i.fq; done

Now, run partitioning::

   python ~/khmer/scripts/do-partition.py -x 4e9 -N 4 -T 16 both *.below.fq

This will take a while.

After partitioning is done, exactract the partitions::

   python ~/khmer/scripts/extract-partitions.py both SRR*.part

Rename the partitions and compress::

   mv both.group0000.fa collection1.dn.fa
   mv both.group0001.fa collection2.dn.fa
   mv both.group0002.fa collection3.dn.fa
   mv both.group0003.fa collection4.dn.fa
   gzip collection*.fa

Now, put them in a nice subdirectory and extract out specific
partitions just for the heck of it (well, really, so that we have some
smaller files to work with)::

   mkdir datasets
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py collection4.dn.fa.gz 126039 > datasets/partition1.fa &
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py collection4.dn.fa.gz 130241 > datasets/partition2.fa &
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py collection4.dn.fa.gz 67910 > datasets/partition3.fa &
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py collection4.dn.fa.gz 71690 > datasets/partition4.fa &

These collection and partition files are now things that you can work with
and assemble independently, etc.

Pulling out the original, unnormalized sequences
------------------------------------------------

Let's suppose you want to pull out the original reads to produce
partitions that reflect non- diginormed data, i.e. that contain their
original abundances.  How do you this?

Briefly, use the 'sweep-reads3' script::

   cd datasets

   mkdir 1
   cd 1
   ln -fs ../*.fa .
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/sweep-reads3.py -x 1e9 -k 20 *.fa ../../SRR172902-trim.fastq
   cd ../

   mkdir 2
   cd 2
   ln -fs ../*.fa .
   python ~/khmer/sandbox/sweep-reads3.py -x 1e9 -k 20 *.fa ../../SRR172902-trim.fastq
   cd ../

Now, combine the resulting files::

   for i in 1 2 3 4
   do
     cat 1/partition$i.fa 2/partition$i.fa | gzip -c > partition$i.orig.fa.gz
   done

and while we're at it, rename the dn files::

   for i in 1 2 3 4
   do
      mv partition$i.fa partition$i.dn.fa
      gzip partition$i.dn.fa &
   done

And these are the files we used previously.

Finally, you can calculate k-mer abundance histograms for everything, like so::

   for i in *.fa.gz
   do
     python ~/khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py -x 3e8 $i.kh $i 
     python ~/khmer/scripts/abundance-dist.py $i.kh $i $i.hist
   done
