Metagenomic assembly - STAMPS 2012, day 1
=========================================

C. Titus Brown

**Note**: this is an adaptation of a 2011 set of tutorials, available
at http://ged.msu.edu/angus/metag-assembly-2011/, that shows you how
to do this in the Amazon cloud.  This tutorial is meant to work on
the STAMPS systems at MBL, instead.

---

Log into your work machine, and make sure you're in your home directory.
You'll also want to load the bioware module::

  %% cd
  %% module load bioware

Now, build the 'khmer' software package from https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer::

  %% git clone git://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git
  %% cd khmer
  %% make

  %% export PYTHONPATH=~/khmer/python:$PYTHONPATH

(Note that you will probably want to install 'screed' if you're not doing
this on the STAMPS systems; see https://github.com/ged-lab/screed.)

OK, next, let's make a directory to work in::

  %% cd
  %% mkdir assembly
  %% cd assembly

Now let's try running the `Velvet assembler <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/>`__ on our data set.  First, use 'velveth' to build the assembly graph in
the subdirectory 'corn.33' using a setting of k=33, taking gzipped FASTA
reads from '/class/shared/titus/smallcorn.fa.gz'::

  %% /class/shared/titus/bin/velveth corn.33 33 -fasta.gz -short /class/shared/titus/smallcorn.fa.gz

Next, run the 'velvetg' component of Velvet. This is what actually generates
contigs by traversing the graph.

A few notes here: we're setting the expected coverage to automatic,
but turning off the coverage cutoff; this will make the assembler more
sensitive to low abundance k-mers, at the risk of introducing errors.
We also turn off scaffolding, because at least with Velvet, we've
found scaffolding to be very prone to introducing mis-assemblies. ::

  %% /class/shared/titus/bin/velvetg corn.33 -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff 0 -scaffolding no

Now let's check out the results -- they're in corn.33/contigs.fa, as FASTA
files.

assemstats3 just does a simple counting up of the number of contigs &
total size of contigs above the specified length::

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 0 corn*/contigs.fa

You can also try running an assembly with a longer k::

  %% /class/shared/titus/bin/velveth corn.35 35 -fasta.gz -short /class/shared/titus/smallcorn.fa.gz
  %% /class/shared/titus/bin/velvetg corn.35 -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff 0 -scaffolding no

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 0 corn*/contigs.fa

Sooooooo... what's the true & right answer?

Well, let's try subtracting the two assemblies from each other.  If one
includes the other, mostly, then we can choose that one... right??

First, extract all the "contigs" greater than 100 bases from both::

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-long-sequences.py 100 corn.33/contigs.fa > corn-33.fa
  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-long-sequences.py 100 corn.35/contigs.fa > corn-35.fa

Next, run our 'assembly diff' tool to subtract one from the other::

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assembly-diff-2.py corn-33.fa corn-35.fa
  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assembly-diff-2.py corn-35.fa corn-33.fa

Now look at the '*.uniq' files, which contain sequences unique to one
assembly or the other.  Both 'uniq' files contain sequence.  Are they
real?  (In many cases, yes; try BLASTing them against NCBI nr) Which
assembly is correct?  This is the mystery you are left to ponder...

As I'll tell you during the talk, the 'k' parameter is problematic for
metagenomics -- not implicitly because of the overlap consideration,
but because of coverage.  MetaVelvet, an adaptation of Velvet for
metagenomic data, tries to address this by adapting coverage to the
local sequence structure (again -- I'll talk about it :).

Let's try running MetaVelvet -- it takes advantage of the information that
was already produced by running velveth, so you don't need to run
velveth again::

  %% /class/shared/titus/bin/meta-velvetg corn.33 -cov_cutoff 0 -scaffolding no

and let's look at the results. ::

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 100 corn.33/*contigs.fa
  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 500 corn.33/*contigs.fa

In this case, they're not that different, but that's because this data
set is *really* low coverage.  I'll point you at some higher coverage
data sets later today or tomorrow.
