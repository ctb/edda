Calculating k-mer abundance distributions
=========================================

Make sure you've got khmer installed (as in :doc:`stamps-assembly-1`) as well
as the 'bioware' module loaded.  Log into your server and create a new
directory::

  %% cd
  %% mkdir abund
  %% cd abund

Now, count all the k-mers in a random reads data set that I created for you;
if you're interested in how to create random genomes, I can point you
towards the scripts. ::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py -x 1e8 -N 4 -k 20 counts.kh /class/shared/random/reads.fa

Next, calculate the abundance distribution of the k-mers::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/abundance-dist.py -s counts.kh /class/shared/random/reads.fa reads.dist

Let's take a look at the output file, 'reads.dist'::

  %% head reads.dist

Here, the first column is the k-mer abundance; the second column is
the number of k-mers with that abundance in the data set; the third
column is the cumulative sum of column 2; and the fourth column is the
fraction of *total* k-mers with an abundance of this or lower
(i.e. fraction of total in column 3).

Now, let's plot it -- ::

  %% python /class/shared/titus/plot-kmer-dist.py reads.dist

This will produce a file called 'reads.dist.abund.pdf'.  Copy it over
via scp or Dropbox, and take a look at it -- you'll notice that it's
abundance-1 dominated, because of the errors!

You can adjust the Y max value by passing it in as the last parameter::

  %% python plot-kmer-dist.py reads.dist 1000

...and that's how you plot k-mer abundance distributions.  It's a good
way to look at your data, and it will be especially important for
people doing assembly tomorrow.
