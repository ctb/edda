Comparing assemblies done with different k values
=================================================

Here we're going to answer the age-old question: which is better, k=31
or k=33?

@@smallcorn.fa

Get the small corn data set::

  %% cd /mnt
  %% mkdir corn
  %% cd corn
  %% @@

Assemble with two different k values, 31 and 33::

  %% velveth corn.33 33 -fasta -short smallcorn.fa
  %% velvetg corn.33 -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff 0 -scaffolding no

  %% velveth corn.31 31 -fasta -short smallcorn.fa
  %% velvetg corn.31 -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff 0 -scaffolding no

Now run assemstats3::

  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 100 corn.*/contigs.fa

You should see this::

  ** cutoff: 100
  N  sum  max    filename
  7661    1664903 4296 corn.31/contigs.fa
  8177    1784032 4167 corn.33/contigs.fa

OK, clearly k=33 is better, right?  Right?

Well, let's see... let's do a comparison.  First, extract just those
sequences > 100.

  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/extract-long-sequences.py 100 corn.33/contigs.fa > corn33.fa
  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/extract-long-sequences.py 100 corn.31/contigs.fa > corn31.fa

Now let's subtract the sequences using a khmer tool::

  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/assembly-diff-2.py corn33.fa corn31.fa
  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/assembly-diff-2.py corn31.fa corn33.fa

Here, 'assembly-diff-2.py' is looking for unique 100-bp-or-longer
sequences that do not appear in the second file; it outputs them
to .uniq files. 

Now run::

  %% ls -la *.uniq

You'll see something like this::

  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 68307 Dec 13 03:03 corn31.fa.uniq
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 83791 Dec 13 03:02 corn33.fa.uniq

which tells you that ...

If you page down to one of the longer 'uniq' sequences, in corn31.fa.uniq,
and grab it -- say,

   CTTCTTCGCGGGTGATACAGGCTACCACCCGGAGTTCAACAGGATCGGCGAGCGCTATGGTCCGTTCGACATCGCATTAC
   TTCCGATAGGAGCGTACGACCCGCGCTGGTTCATGCGACCCGTGCACATGGACCCCGAGGAGGCGGTGCGCGCCTTCCTC
   GAGATCAGCGACGGCAGTGCCGTGGCAGCCGGATCGCCGCCACTGCGCCGCATCGCGCTCGGCATCCACTGGGGCACCTTC

and then BLASTX it against the nr database (use `this link
<http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastx&BLAST_PROGRAMS=blastx&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&SHOW_DEFAULTS=on&LINK_LOC=blasthome>`__
if you want to try) you'll see that some of these sequences look
"real", in the sense that they have homology to known proteins.  (The
one above looks like it's from a phospholipase D.)

If you poke around a bit more, you'll find that many of the sequences
that appear in one assembly (at, say, k=33) but not in another assembly
(say, k=31) appear to be real.  What does this mean?  As far as we can
tell, it means that there *is* no single, real best k to use.

Welcome to metagenomics!!!
