We thought we'd highlight some useful khmer scripts and their usage.  We
assume you've already successfully installed khmer.  The scripts shown here
will not include those used for partitioning a dataset as those will be
covered in a different tutorial.

Quality Filtering of Illumina Sequences

Quality scores at the ends of reads are unreliable, and Illumina has a special
indicator (a quality score of 2, encoded as "B") to flag this region.  See the
following post for more information:
(http://news.open-bio.org/news/2010/04/illumina-q2-trim-fastq/).  

In khmer, we use:

   %% python khmer/scripts/quality-trim.py <input fastq> <output fastq>

File Format Changes

   %% python khmer/scripts/fasta-to-fastq.py <input> > <output>
   %% python khmer/scripts/fastq-to-fasta.py <input> > <output>

You may change the parameters of the filtering within the script (i.e. K-size,
HT size, number of HTs, abundance threshold).  This script removes reads whose
k-mers are all greater than the abundance threshold.  Be aware of the choosing
the correct HT size appropriate for your dataset size (diversity).

Characterizing Diversity with a Dataset

We often use the diversity of k-mers within a dataset to evaluate the
diversity within it or to estimate memory requirements for other processing
(i.e. partitioning).

   %% python khmer/scripts/bloom_count.py <input> <K-mer length> <HT Size> <#
   of HT>

The first line output of this script will be the number of unique k-mers.
The second line output is the occupancy with the hashtable.  
The third line output is a double-check on the total number of unique k-mers
(it should be the same as the first line).

If you want to get the distribution of k-mer abundances in your dataset, you
can do the following:

First, build a counting Bloom filter from your sequences.  Note that you can
   change the default HT sizes to suit your needs.

   %% python khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py <htname> <input data>

Next, generate kmer-abundance-histogram from counting bloom filter.

   %% python khmer/scripts/kmer-abundance-hist.py <htname> <input data>
   <output>

Removing high abundance k-mers

In the metahit (Qin et al, 2010) and rumen (Hess et al, 2011) assemblies, low
   abundance k-mers were removed prior to assembly to reduce computational
   requirements.  Perhaps you've looked at your k-mer abundance distribution
   by generationg the k-mer abundance histogram, and you now wnat to remove
   low abundance k-mers.

   %% python khmer/scripts/filter-inexact-all.py <input> <output>

You may change the parameters of the filtering within the script (i.e. K-size,
HT size, number of HTs, abundance threshold).  This script removes reads whose
k-mers are all greater than the abundance threshold.  Be aware of the choosing
the correct HT size appropriate for your dataset size (diversity).

K-mer Coverage of Assembled Contigs

So you have an assembly, now what?  Maybe you'd like to look at how the
originating reads map back to the assembled contigs.  There are programs to do
this (i.e. Bowtie, BWA, etc).  However, we can also do this at the k-mer
coverage level (vs. read coverage) with our Bloom filter data structure, and
we can get it done really fast.  

First, we build our counting filter to count the k-mers within our reads.

   %% python khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py <htname> <input data>

Next, we go through the k-mers in our assembled contigs and query the bloom
filter to see how many k-mers from our reads match the contig's k-mer.  The
output from this script gives you the median, average, and std dev of the
k-mer coverage estimates and the length of the assembled sequence for each contig.  

   %% python khmer/scripts/count-median-exp.py <htname> <assembled contigs
   data> > <output file>

To change the sensitivity/specificity of this estimate, you can change the
K-length within the scripts.
