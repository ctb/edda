Mapping reads to a reference
----------------------------

Create a new directory to do the mapping in::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir mapping
   cd mapping

For now, copy over an E. coli assembly that we just created::

   cp /mnt/velvet/ecoli.31/contigs.fa ./my-assembly.fa

Build an index for this assembly that bowtie can use::

   bowtie2-build my-assembly.fa my-assembly

Now, split the reads up again, because bowtie wants 'em split::

   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/split-pe.py ../velvet/combined-trim.fq.pe

Let's take a subset of the reads, just for speed reasons::

   head -400000 combined-trim.fq.pe.1 > reads.1
   head -400000 combined-trim.fq.pe.2 > reads.2

Now, map the reads to the assembly and produce a SAM file::

   bowtie2 -f -p 8 -x my-assembly -1 reads.1 -2 reads.2 -S my-mapping.sam

and then convert the SAM file to a sorted BAM file::

   samtools view -uS my-mapping.sam > my-mapping.bam
   samtools sort my-mapping.bam my-mapping.bam.sorted
   samtools index my-mapping.bam.sorted.bam

The output will be in my-mapping.bam.sorted.bam and my-mapping.bam.sorted.bam.bai.

You can copy these into your dropbox::

   cp my-assembly.fa my-mapping.bam.sorted.bam* ~/Dropbox

and use Tablet or another viewer to look at them, OR you can call SNPs.

To call SNPs, do::

   samtools faidx my-assembly.fa
   samtools mpileup -uD -f my-assembly.fa my-mapping.bam.sorted.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - > my-mapping.raw.bcf
   bcftools view my-mapping.raw.bcf > my-mapping.vcf

This gives you a VCF file that contains the SNP calls.
