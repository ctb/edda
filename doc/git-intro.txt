An intro to git
===============

For this section, you'll need to install:

.. Enthought Python Distribution

Git, for Mac OS X: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list
or for Windows: http://git-scm.com/download/win

You'll also need to sign up on an account at github.com (for the stuff
at the bottom).

On Windows, after installing things, you may want to set up notepad++
as your git editor, as in `this stackoverflow page
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10564/how-can-i-set-up-an-editor-to-work-with-git-on-windows>`__.

On Windows, you may also need to use the Git Bash shell -- go to the Start
menu, then select Git, Git Bash.  It should work 

Then run ::

Getting started
---------------

Create your own project::

  % mkdir theproj
  % cd theproj
  % git init

  % curl -O http://lyorn.idyll.org/~t/transfer/data.txt

Create a file 'calc.py' and put in this code::

  import sys

  x = []
  for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
     num = int(line)
     x.append(num)

  print 'average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))

Now, let's see what git knows about them::

  % git status

nothing!  ok... let's tell git about 'em. ::

  % git add calc.py data.txt

This converts them into *tracked files*, files that git knows and cares
about.

Now we need to tell git that we are done making changes to these files,
for now. ::

  % git commit -am "script and data for calculating averages"

This stores those files with the note that they are part of a bundle
of changes to the repository, aka a commit, for calculating averages.
This may seem silly right now -- you just created those files, of
course you know what they are! -- but just wait.

OK, now let's change the 'calc.py' script to output the sum of the squares
of the differences, too; make it look like this::

  import sys

  x = []
  for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
     num = int(line)
     x.append(num)

  avg = sum(x) / float(len(x))

  diffs = []
  for num in x:
     diff = num - avg
     diffs.append(diff**2)

  print 'average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))
  print 'sumsqdiffs is', sum(diffs)

(Just pass in everything after the first 'for' loop.)

Now, do a 'git status'.  You'll see that 'calc.py' is changed, but not
'data.txt'.  This is the first reason to like and use version control:
it will tell you what's been changed.  To find out *exactly* what
changed, type ::

  % git diff calc.py

This will output a strange looking format known as a 'diff'.  The main
thing to look for here is the '-' (which will be in front of the old
lines) and the '+' (which will be in front of new or changed lines).
The --- and +++ are for context, and the '@@' tells you what line numbers
have been changed.

Assuming you're happy with these changes, do::

  % git commit -am "updated calc.py to display sum sq diffs, too"

Let's take a retrospective look at what we've done to the repository.
Try typing 'git log'.  You will see a list of commits, along with the
commit messages, tracing back what you've done in the past.  You can
compare current with past, e.g. ::

  % git diff <old commit # prefix>

or any two past commits ::

  % git diff <commit prefix 1>..<commit prefix 2>

and git will tell you exactly what lines have changed between those commits.

Note that you can use shorthand here: if you use the commit id
'HEAD^', it refers to last-commit-but-one, and 'HEAD^^' to
last-commit-but-two', etc.  ('git diff HEAD' is the same as 'git diff'
-- it compares to the 'head' of the version control history, or the
latest commit.)

---

Digression: three important terms: working copy, staged copy, and
repository copy.  The working copy is the
edited/changed-but-not-added; the staged copy is the
added-but-not-committed; and the repository copy is all the committed
stuff.  By using 'commit -a' you're skipping the 'add each file
explicitly' step, which I generally do.

---

Suppose you're unhappy with the latest commit or commit message -- how can
you move back to an old version?  This is actually fairly complicated and
rich with many different possibilities, but the main thing you'll probably
end up needing to do is roll back to the latest commit -- to do that,
do ::

  % git reset HEAD^

which "uncommits" the last commit, but leaves the changes in your
current directory; try 'git log', 'git diff', and 'git status'. You
can now do one of two things: fix the commit (by editing, and then
committing again), OR you can trash the whole commit, by doing ::

  % git checkout -f

which says "hey, I don't want any of these changes -- trash 'em all".
Needless to say this is a bit extreme, but it's the most straightforward
way to clean up your working copy and make it look like the latest commit.
(You can do this at any time if you want to throw away all your changes;
you don't have to do a reset first.)

A third option -- if you want to try something different out, without
throwing away the last commit -- is to make a branch.  But that is a
bit too complicated for right now; we'll look at that option later.

So this is the second reason why version control is cool: it lets you
keep track of each individual set of changes, from day zero.  Greg
refers to this as provenance of the source code, and it is important
for two reasons:

First, it's important scientifically because it allow you trace the
set of changes to analysis code or modeling code in the context of a
timeline.  You can ask yourself, why did my model results change
between last week and this week?  and track down exactly where the
change occurs in the source code.

Second, and far more pragmatically, if you find that you broke
something subtle, it gives you a way to track down exactly what lines
of code were modified.  These sound like the same things, but I use
these things more for tracking down bugs that I recently introduced
than anything else...

**Exercise** Add "print 'hello, world'" to the bottom of your calc.py
script, make sure it runs, and then commit the changes to your repository.
For extra credit, then use 'git reset HEAD^' to uncommit, and recommit
with a different commit message.

Working on multiple versions of your code
-----------------------------------------

OK, suppose now that you want to have two versions of your code.  One is
the "safe" version of your code, and the other is the "daring edgy" version
of your code.  For example, suppose you're adding some nifty new features
but you don't want to "break" your existing code, which you're using to
run analyses.  What do you do?

The simplest (but not yet the easiest) thing to do is make a copy of your
project.  From within the 'theproj' directory, type::

  % cd ..
  % git clone theproj theproj_new

This makes a complete copy of the git repository and puts it into
'theproj_new'.  Let's go there and do some wild and crazy edits. ::

  % cd theproj_new

and edit calc.py to look like this::

  import sys
  import math
  
  x = []
  for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
     num = int(line)
     x.append(num)
  
  avg = sum(x) / float(len(x))
  
  diffs = []
  for num in x:
     diff = num - avg
     diffs.append(diff**2)
  
  stddev = math.sqrt(sum(diffs) / float(len(x)))
  
  print 'average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))
  print 'sumsqdiffs is', sum(diffs)
  print 'stddev is', stddev

The diff looks like this::

   import sys
  +import math
   
   x = []
   for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
  @@ -12,6 +13,8 @@ for num in x:
      diff = num - avg
      diffs.append(diff**2)
   
  +stddev = math.sqrt(sum(diffs) / float(len(x)))
  +
   print 'average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))
   print 'sumsqdiffs is', sum(diffs)
  +print 'stddev is', stddev

OK, verify that it runs and then commit it::

  % git commit -am "added stddev"

Now let's go back to the 'safe' repository, 'theproj', and edit calc.py
to print the *average* sum sq diffs.  Commit that, too::

  % cd ../theproj
  (edit stuff to print sum(diffs) / float(len(x)); make sure it works)
  % git commit -am "changed to print avg sum sq diffs"

Now pretend that this has taken a month or two, and you've been working
on both repositories.  Now you decide that you want to compare, and maybe
combine, the changes in the two repositories.  What do you do?

Well, because these two repositories share history -- until you made the
changes above, they *were* the same repository -- you can actually do this
pretty easily.

Let's start by comparing the two sets of changes.  Make sure you're in the
'theproj' repository, and type::

  % git fetch ../theproj_new master:edgy

This will take all of the changes in the 'theproj_new' repository and
bring them over to the 'theproj' repository, but as a separate bundle
of changes, called a 'branch'.  Try typing 'git branch' and you should
see two branches, one called 'master' and one called 'edgy'.

So, let's try comparing them; how do you do that?  Any guesses? ::

  % git diff edgy

or ::

  % git diff master..edgy

do the same thing -- they compare your *current* branch, 'master', to the
'edgy' branch.

You can actually switch branches pretty easily -- do::

  % git checkout edgy

and then use 'git branch' to look at the branches --:: 
 
  % git branch

and you'll see that the '*' has moved over to 'edgy', to reflect that you
are now on the edgy branch.

Switch back to the 'master' branch using 'git checkout master'.  Verify
that you're on the master branch using either 'git status' or 'git branch'.

OK, let's say you're happy with both sets of changes.  Awesome!  Let's
merge them in.  To do this, just type ::

  % git merge edgy

Assuming you made only the changes we went through, this should just work,
because git is smart enough to figure out that all the changes you made
to both branches were syntactically orthogonal, or, to be simpler, didn't
interfere and could be merged automatically.  **Note** that this doesn't
mean that the changes won't interfere semantically -- for example, if you
changed the meaning of one of the variables, there's no way for git to
track that sort of thing.  So you still need to worry about whether or not
your code still works even after an automatic merge!

Note that you can now delete the 'edgy' branch::

  % git branch -d edgy

because it's been merged into your current branch.  Generally it's not
a good idea to do this without a good reason -- branches don't take up
much extra space.  I generally wait until my project reaches a good resting
point before cleaning up my repositories.

OK, let's do something even edgier!  Let's try to merge a branch with
conflicting changes (how exciting!)

First, we need to make some conflicting changes.  Let's start by forking off
a new branch -- ::

  % git checkout -b edgier

This is the same as the sequence of cloning to a new repository and
then fetching the branch back, but it doesn't go through another
repository -- it just makes a new branch in the same repository, based
on the current branch, and switches you to it.  (Verify this with 'git
branch' and 'git diff master' -- you should be on branch 'edgier', and
there should be no changes in comparison to master.)

OK, make a change to the bottom of the script.  Replace the print lines
with::

  avg = sum(x) / float(len(x))
  sumsqdiffs = sum(diffs) / float(len(x))

  print 'average is', avg, 'and sumsqdiffs is', sumsqdiffs
  print 'stddev is', stddev

Save and commit these::

  % git commit -am "cleaned up print statements"

Now remember, these are on the 'edgier' branch!  Let's switch back to the
'master' branch ::

  % git checkout master

and make some changes there, too; edit the 'print average' line to say ::

  print 'the average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))

Now commit that::

  % git commit -am "became less russian"

Now let's see what we've done!  Diff the two versions::

  % git diff edgier

Ruh-oh!  If you look closely, you'll see that the diff reflects that the
same line was modified in the two different branches.  What happens when
you do a merge? ::

  % git merge edgier

  Auto-merging calc.py
  CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in calc.py
  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Now if you go look into calc.py, you'll see some confusing looking
gobbledygook::

  <<<<<<< HEAD:calc.py
  print 'the average is', sum(x) / float(len(x))
  print 'sumsqdiffs is', sum(diffs)
  =======
  avg = sum(x) / float(len(x))
  sumsqdiffs = sum(diffs) / float(len(x))
  
  print 'average is', avg, 'and sumsqdiffs is', sumsqdiffs
  >>>>>>> edgier:calc.py
 
This just tells you that are two conflicting sections of the file that you
need to *manually* resolve.  The <<< and >>> and === are just markers
telling you where to look.

In this case, you can do fix the problem by getting rid of the stuff between
the <<< and ====, and also removing the >>> line.  If you want to stay less
Russian you can put a 'the' in front of 'average is'.  At the end of the
edits, your code should look like this::

  avg = sum(x) / float(len(x))
  sumsqdiffs = sum(diffs) / float(len(x))
  
  print 'the average is', avg, 'and sumsqdiffs is', sumsqdiffs
  print 'stddev is', stddev

without any of the <<< or >>> or === lines still around.

After verifying that things work, you can now do a 'git commit'::

  % git commit -am "merged edgier and less russian changes"

and you're all set.

**Exercise** Make a new branch named 'exercise', and create a new file
'README.txt' that contains a text description of this project.  Add
it with 'git add', then commit it, and then merge it into the master
branch.

---

So, this is the third big reason why version control is good: it lets you
track independent branches of work, and merge them if and when you are
ready.

You can imagine a bunch of examples where this is useful.

For one, if you are working on getting a set of results for a paper,
you can "freeze" your code in one branch (for the purpose of running
it, tweaking the output, etc.) while going ahead and doing further
development on another branch; this is pretty common in my lab.

For another, if you actually *publish* a paper, you can freeze the
version of the code for that paper on a branch (or with something
called a 'tag') and then when people ask to replicate your work, you
can just give them the old branch.

For a third, sometimes you want to try out a particular idea or line
of attack on a problem, but don't want to have to explicitly remember
when and where you started working on it.  You can just fork off a branch
and work on that as long as you want, and then when it gets to a good place,
merge it; or, if it never pans out, just discard it.

But the BIGGEST reason to use branches and merging is that it lets you
COLLABORATE on code with other people.  You see, you can clone other
people's repositories, and fetch from other people's repositories,
too!  All you need is access to the repositories, which means either
giving other people access to your laptop (boo); having a shared
development space (plausible, but potentially complicated); OR using
a shared central space.

For this purpose, we're going to introduce you to github.

Using github
------------

Let's start by going to https://github.com/ctb/theproj in a Web
browser and clicking on 'fork' -- make sure you're logged into
github.com first!

This will create a new copy of my 'theproj' repository under your
account on github.

Now, on your laptop, go to the directory above your 'theproj'
directory and make your own local copy of your github repository.
First, grab the 'http' URL from your github repository; it should
be under the 'http' tab just under the description of the project,
and look something like this: 'https://ctb@github.com/ctb/theproj.git'

At the command line, type::

  % cd ../
  % git clone https://<user>@github.com/<user>/theproj.git newproj

replacing the URL on the last line with YOUR github project URL.

Assuming everything worked, you'll have a directory 'newproj' containing
'calc.py' and 'data.txt'.  This is essentially the same thing that you've
been working on above, but now it's a clone of my own repository that
I developed when creating this tutorial.

It's a full git repo -- do 'git log', 'git status', etc. etc. after 
changing into the directory::

  % cd newproj

OK, now, let's make some changes!!  Go in and change something in the
script -- put a comment at the top, or change a print statement to do
something else, or whatever.  Then make sure it works, and commit it::

  % git commit -am "a random change"

Now you'll want to *push* it to github.  Ordinarily you should do everything
in git with a 'fetch', in which you pull things into your repository; but
in this case, you don't actually have command line access to your repository!
So you need to push.  Type::

  % git push origin master

and this will send the changes back to github under your fork of my
repository.  You should see them if you go back to the github.com
Web page and look at 'history'.

And voila! These changes are now publicly available to anyone who wants
to fetch them into their own repository.  You just need to fetch from
THEIR github URL, which will be using THEIR github username.

Now, at this point, you have everything you need to work collaboratively.

**Exercise** Make a change to one of the files in your repository, and
push it to github.  Then find someone nearby and fetch & merge their
changes into your own repository.

---

This is the FOURTH big reason to use version control: it lets you
collaborate on writing code with others, sanely and easily.  Github is
a convenient site for sharing that I used for this tutorial (and it is
what I personally use for sharing code); but you can share git
branches any number of ways, include if you have a shared host that
you can ssh into.

---

Four final quick things I'd like to point out: 'git
pull', commit comments, pull requests, and 'git stash'.

1. 'git pull' is shorthand for 'fetch-then-merge', i.e. it's the same
as doing 'git fetch <other_repo> <remote_branch>:<local_branch>'
followed by a 'git merge <local_branch>'.

2. You can comment on lines of code in commits on github.

3. You can't change other people's repositories on github, but you CAN
ask them to merge your changes into their repository.  There's
actually a formal mechanism for requesting that someone merge a change
you made into their software; check out 'pull requests' on github,
http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/.

4. Suppose you're working on a branch, and have made some changes but
aren't read to commit them just yet, but you need to switch over to
another branch to make a quick bug fix.  You *could* do a 'git commit'
and then 'git reset HEAD^' to uncommit it, but that's ugly and you're
likely to forget.  Recent versions of git offer 'stashing' functionality:
you can type 'git stash' to stash your current changes away in a special
place, and then go off and do other stuff. When you're ready to resume?
'git stash apply' will apply the last set of things you stashed.  This
is also handy if you find yourself working on the wrong branch and want
to move your changes over to a different working copy -- do 'git stash',
then 'git checkout' a new branch, and 'git stash apply'.

---

Concluding thoughts
-------------------

So, in conclusion, version control systems let you --

1. track changes (wanted and unwanted) in your files.

2. keep track of an entire history of changes.

3. track multiple independent "branches" of work.

4. collaborate sanely.

There are other reasons that I didn't mention above, too.  One reason
that I almost *always* use version control is that it's a backup against
my own stupidity - if I delete a file, or I tweak it in some way that I
can't immediately figure out, I can always restore it, as long as I've
got it in version control!  Plus, if I'm using github, then it's somewhere
else, so even if my computer gets stolen or dies horribly, I can recover
it.

So, you definitely want to use version control.  Do you want to use git,
in particular?  That's not so clear.

There are a lot of version control systems, and it's not so important
whether you use git or rather mercurial (hg) or subversion (which are the
two other really commonly used ones at the moment).  Just **use version
control**.

That having been said, branching and merging with git is really,
really easy, which is why I like it; and, in general, it's a great
tool that has relatively few drawbacks.  The biggest positive is
github, which is awesome; the biggest negative is the terse and rather
unforgiving and complex command syntax.

We haven't talked much about the difference between distributed
version control systems (like git and hg) and centralized version
control system like subversion.  If you've used version control in the
past, you've probably used something centralized; the disadvantage
there is that you have to set up a server, and permissions, and cannot
commit when you don't have a connection to the server (like on an
airplane).  The advantage, however, is that there is never any
ambiguity about collaboration order: you get a unique, monotonically
increasing version number.  Greg likes this; I don't care that much.
