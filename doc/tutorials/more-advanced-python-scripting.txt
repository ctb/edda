Slightly more advanced scripting with Python

There are two really useful data types in Python that you should know
how to use, lists and dictionaries.

Lists
-----

You already have some experience with lists: they're what we're stuffing
data points into in :doc:`plotting-with-matplotlib` with 'data.append'.
A list just contains an ordered list of things, such as numbers and/or
strings.  Note that lists can contain multiple types; a list doesn't need
to contains *just* numbers.

Here's some example Python code::

   >>> x = []
   >>> x.append('foo')
   >>> x.append(5)
   >>> print x
   ['foo', 5]

   >>> for val in x:
   ...   print val
   foo
   5

Lists are great ways to keep track of random stuff, and because they're
*ordered* you can break rows into multiple lists and still keep track of
row correlations.  For example, as long as you add things in in a
consistent order, you can retrieve them in the same order::

   >>> x = []
   >>> y = []
   >>> x.append(1)
   >>> x.append(2)

   >>> y.append(6)
   >>> y.append(7)

   >>> print x[0], y[0]
   1 6
   >>> print x[1], y[1]
   2 7

You can use for loops to go through multiple lists using zip::

   >>> for xval, yval in zip(x, y):
   ...   print xval, yval
   1 6
   2 7

Think of it as joining the lists with a zipper...

Dictionaries
------------

Dictionaries are probably the single most useful data structure ever
for bioinformatics!  Basically dictionaries let you link a unique key
(name, id, number, whatever) to a Python object -- which can be pretty
much anything, like a number, string, list, or another dictionary.

This is extremely useful for situations in which you need to correlate
data from different data sets, where the data sets have a common key.
If the data rows are in a different order in the different data sets,
then you'll need to use a dictionary for this purpose.

We've already seen one example of dictionary use in the reciprocal
BLAST code, `find-reciprocal.py
<http://bitbucket.org/ctb/ngs-course/src/tip/blast/find-reciprocal.py>`__,
where we're loading in two data sets -- BLAST of zebrafish v mouse,
and mouse v zebrafish -- 

The four essential commands are::

  >>> d = {}

to create a new dictionary,

  >>> key = 'foo'
  >>> value = 'bar'

  >>> d[key] = value

to set the value for the key 'foo' equal to 'bar',

  >>> val = d[key]
  >>> val
  'bar'

to retrieve the value associated with the key 'foo' (which will be
'bar')

One really important thing about dictionaries is that there are a lot
of Python libraries that look like dictionaries (a.k.a. "follow the
mapping protocol).  Pretty much any data container in Python can be made
to look like a dictionary.

For example...

More FASTA stuff, with screed
-----------------------------

...we can use the screed FASTA/FASTQ parser library to make FASTA and FASTQ
files look like dictionaries.

Let's start by installing screed::

  %% cd ~/
  %% apt-get -y install git-core
  %% git clone http://github.com/acr/screed.git
  %% cd screed
  %% python setup.py install

Now let's get some reasonably big FASTA file, like our mRNAseq library
from lamprey work::

  %% mkdir /mnt/fasta
  %% cd /mnt/fasta
  %% curl -O http://angus.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/lamprey-rnatigs.fa.gz
  %% gunzip lamprey-rnatigs.fa.gz

Now index it::

  %% python ~/screed/screed/fadbm.py lamprey-rnatigs.fa

(Use 'fqdbm.py' for FASTQ files.)

From now on, you can use 'screed' to access sequences from this file as if
they're in a dictionary.

One more script: RPKM adjustment
--------------------------------

One reasonably common thing to do with mRNAseq is adjust expression
levels by the size of the mRNA transcript, e.g. "reads per kilobase of
mRNA". As we discussed, you still can't numerically compare these
expression levels within a sample, but it *is* possible to get some
idea of relative expression levels by normalizing to the transcript
length.  (You also still need to do quantile normalization to compare
between samples, too!)

In order to do this adjustment, you need two things: the original count
per molecule, and the length of the sequence.  However, because the
data isn't "in order" -- that is, the counts aren't listed in the same order
as the sequences are in the FASTA file -- you have to be able to look up
the length of any given FASTA sequence.  So let's use screed to do this!

First, update your 'ngs-course' directory::

   %% cd ~/ngs-course
   %% hg pull -u

Now, go back to the 'fasta' directory::

   %% cd /mnt/fasta

and grab an mRNAseq 'count' file::

   %% curl -O http://angus.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/lamprey-mrnaseq-a.count.gz
   %% gunzip lamprey-mrnaseq-a.count.gz

Now, run the 'rpkm.py' script on the database and count file::

   %% python ~/ngs-course/mrnaseq/rpkm.py lamprey-rnatigs.fa lamprey-mrnaseq-a.count

The key part of `the rpkm script
<http://bitbucket.org/ctb/ngs-course/src/tip/mrnaseq/rpkm.py>`__ is
the following code::

  seqdb = screed.ScreedDB(sequence_database)

  for line in open(counts_file):
      count, name = line.strip().split()  # parse lines like '1523 geneX'
      count = int(count)

      # look up the sequence in the seqdb dictionary-like database.
      sequence_length = len(seqdb[name].sequence)

where in the last line we look up the sequence record in the database,
as if it were a dictionary.

There's a plethora of good material out there for learning how to
program in Python:

Honestly, start with `the Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`__.

`Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html>`__

`Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry in Python
<http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/advanced-swc/>`__ has a few good
student-oriented tips, although it's out of date.
