A fake metagenome
=================

Let's start by playing with a little fake metagenome. ::

  %% mkdir ~/metag/
  %% cd ~/metag

  %% cp ~guest384/data/mixed*.fa .

Count all the k-mers in mixed-reads.fa::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py -x 1e8 -k 20 mixed-reads.kh mixed-reads.fa

Now, output the k-mer abundance distribution::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/abundance-dist.py mixed-reads.kh mixed-reads.fa mixed-reads.dist

You should see data like this in 'mixed-reads.dist'::

   0 0 0 0.0
   1 93387 93387 0.293
   2 28560 121947 0.383
   3 39133 161080 0.505
   4 44776 205856 0.646
   5 40065 245921 0.771
   6 30189 276110 0.866
   7 18983 295093 0.926
   8 10572 305665 0.959
   9 5439 311104 0.976

The first column is the k-mer abundance; the second column is the number
of k-mers with that abundance; the third column is the cumulative number
of k-mers with that abundance or lower; and the 4th column is the fraction
of total k-mers with that abundance or lower.

You can plot this with the following python code::

   import numpy
   x = numpy.loadtxt('mixed-reads.dist')
   axis(ymax=1000)
   plot(x[:,0], x[:,1])

Try changing around the ymax and xmax to look at low-abundance k-mers, etc.

Trimming low-abundance k-mers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To trim reads at any k-mer below 10 in abundance::

   %% python ~/khmer/scripts/filter-abund.py -C 10 mixed-reads.kh mixed-reads.fa

Now let's look at the abundance distribution of the trimmed data::

   %% python ~/khmer/scripts/load-into-counting.py -x 1e8 -k 20 mixed-reads.fa.abundfilt.kh mixed-reads.fa.abundfilt

   %% python ~/khmer/scripts/abundance-dist.py mixed-reads.fa.abundfilt.kh mixed-reads.fa.abundfilt mixed-reads.fa.abundfilt.dist


Applying digital normalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run digital normalization with a k-mer size of 20 and a coverage of 50::

   %% python ~/khmer/scripts/normalize-by-median.py -C 50 -k 20 -x 1e8 --savehash mixed-reads.norm50.kh mixed-reads.fa

Here, the normalize script builds the counting hash table as it runs, and
(with --savehash) saves it for you.  To look at the abundance distribution
of k-mers, just use that table. ::

   %% python ~/khmer/scripts/abundance-dist.py mixed-reads.norm50.kh mixed-reads.fa.keep mixed-reads.fa.keep.dist

Applying partitioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, load the reads into a graph::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/load-graph.py -x 1e8 -k 32 readgraph mixed-reads.fa

Then, partition the graph::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/partition-graph.py --thread 4 -s 1e4 readgraph

Next, merge the partitions::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/merge-partitions.py readgraph

Annotate the sequences with their partition ID::

  %% python ~/khmer/scripts/annotate-partitions.py readgraph mixed-reads.fa

This puts all the annotated sequences in mixed-reads.fa.part.

You can extract these partitions en masse using
'extract-partitions.py', but for now let's just look at the individual
partitions. ::

  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py mixed-reads.fa.part 2 > part2.fa
  %% python ~/khmer/sandbox/extract-single-partition.py mixed-reads.fa.part 3 > part3.fa
